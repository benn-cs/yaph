YAPH - Yet Another Proxy Hunter ver 0.91 README

To get full power of yaph you must have the following programs:
Nmap			http://www.insecure.org/nmap			
ProxyChains        http://proxychains.sourceforge.net

General.
Yaph provides ability to reveal public proxy servers.
It can search&validate socks v4 , socks v5 and http (connect method) proxy servers.
HTTP proxy servers are checked for CONNECT method only.
Validated proxy server is public proxy that can be used for tcp tunneling.
While using tcp tunneling your IP address stays private.
The best tools (proxifiers) for tcp tunneling via proxies are :
ProxyChains (unix)	http://proxychains.sourceforge.net
ProxyCap (win)		http://www.proxylabs.com

List cheking.
Yaph knows to check list of proxy servers to reveal working proxies.
Supported input formats are:
1. Proxy Hunter format   ( the output of proxyhunter ) like:
	192.168.1.2:8080@HTTP
	192.168.1.3:8080@SOCKS4
	192.168.1.4:8080@SOCKS5
2. Proxy Chains format  ( as it appears in proxychains.conf) like:
	http		192.168.1.2		8080
	socks4	192.168.1.3		1080
	socks5	192.168.1.4		1080

Network scan.
Yaph knows to use Nmap to find new proxy servers.
get nmap from: http://www.insecure.org/nmap
all nmap features are usable and supported :)

Stealth mode  - your IP stays unknown.
yaph might be run with ProxyCahins to provide source IP hiding for both
"list cheking" & "network scan"

Tutorial.
You should be root to run yaph with nmap engine!!!!!.
To find public proxies is not a trivial task. Port scans are treated as abuse.
Thus, scan directly from your IP address is not quite a good idea.
However, there are "stealth" techniques to use yaph:
1. Use nmap scan with 7 or more "decoys", it will make "fake" alarms to IDS.
	IDS will see that scan comes form many sources (IP) ,
	while one of them is your real IP.
	However, it is impossible to say for sure which one is originator of the scan,
	when all "decoys" are real hosts that are "online" during the scan.	
2. Use proxychains to hide your IP, while performing validation check for proxies.
	in the logs of target host will be shown IP of proxy used, and not yours.
3. Use decoys and proxychains together, to get speed and anonymity.
	both methods can be used together.

Yet, there is "yaph.conf".
The .conf file describes some internal configurations that may affect performance of yaph
You may want to change there some values :)
The .conf file is well documented also.
Configuration file lookup is performed by yaph in the following order:
1)    ./yaph.conf
2)    /etc/yaph.conf
	


Some examples for stealth scans:

proxychains yaph -D10.1.1.2,10.2.5.1,10.1.3.2,10.2.5.4 10.0.0.*

	in this example, nmap will scan hosts 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.255
	loking for onpen ports 1080,8080,3128
	with decoys 10.1.1.2 10.2.5.1 10.1.3.2 10.2.5.4
	and then validation of open ports will be performed via proxy server
	defined in proxychains.conf

cat proxy_list.txt | sort | uniq | proxychains yaph --use_hunter_stdin

	in this example, yaph wil validate addresses,
	listed in proxy_list in proxyhunter syntax,
	via proxy server defined in proxychains.conf.
       sort & uniq is useful when your list contains not only unique targets
       (some tagrets appear more than once) - it will check only unique targets

proxychains yaph -sT -P0 10.0.0.*
	
	in this example EVERYTHING will go via proxyserver.
	The nmap scan will go through proxy server!!!
	Validation of open ports as well
	scanned hosts are 10.0.0.1 - 10.0.0.255
	(this is slow, but your IP is never appears in the logs of scanned hosts)


Miscelanious examples:

proxychains yaph --use_chains_stdin

       in this example interactive mode is used.
       just type on your console targets in proxychains format
       hint: "type" can be "any" to do all checks fot given port
       like:
              any 192.168.35.46 5041
       will check this host:port  for http, socks4 and socks5 proxy

proxychains yaph --use_chains_stdin

       in this example interactive mode is used.
       just type on your console targets in proxyhunter format
       hint: "type" can be "any" to do all checks fot given port
       like:
              192.168.35.46:5041@ANY
       will check this host:port  for http, socks4 and socks5 proxy

Hint:
     If you are using proxychains set it to "random chain" for more performance
